                       <p> Superb photographer, the finesse with which he captures ur memories is absolutely breathtaking n the best part is he a very humble human who becomes a part of ur family by the end of the functions! My wedding trailer was beautifully made n I’d recommend him for each n everyone who asks me who should they hire for their D-day!

                     This guy is a perfect mix of patience, professionalism and poise. when i decided to go for my pre wedding and wedding photo-shoot, me and my wife were bit apprehensive as we had no idea about candid photography but i remember when we met Sufi he became quite content that our most important memories are going to be in a safe hands. ✌️✌️✌️

                          Pratik Photos was recommended to me by a friend and it turned out to be the best decision! Sufy and team captured such beautiful moments of my wedding, pre wedding and the best was the attitude of the team. Weddings are never easy but they were always smiling and making everyone laugh with their camera skills!
